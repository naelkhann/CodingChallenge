# tripleLift Coding Challenge
# by Nael Khan
This coding challenge required building a reusable form component. The form component is implemented via a Javascript script, CSS styles, and some classes and id attributes to add to your HTML tags.

To start off, add the following files to your working directory and add the following lines to your index.html:
"""html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="form_list.css">
<script src="form_list.js"></script>
"""
